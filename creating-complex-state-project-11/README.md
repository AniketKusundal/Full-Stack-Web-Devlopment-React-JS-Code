===============================>>>>   CREATING    COMPLEX   STATE <<<============================

    [#]--- suppose we want to store multiple variable in the useState then we can write fillowing code 

        const [left , setLeft] = useState (0)
        const [right , setRight] = useState (0)
    
    [#]---  in  this code we can cal use state two time to set the two diffrent variable value but insted of calling useState multiple times we can call useState  only one time By Passing Objct as a Parameter 




    [#]---  In This Example we are passing object as a parameter In UseState this object contain two variable left and right with initial value zero



    [#]---  On the button click we are calling setCount function where  we can change one value or button value
